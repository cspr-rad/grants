# Grant 24-01 Details

## Project

* KYLO :: zkEVM L2 on Casper
* Digichain Global Holdings LLC

## Grant Summary

* Amount

	* 30k USD

* Duration

	* 3 months

* Milestones

	* M1
		* 01/05/24 -> 31/07/24 
		* Payment of 30K USD upon grant signature date.  

## Grant Milestones

* M1
	* Map out ZK (Zero-Knowledge) ecosystem, focusing on identifying key technologies, tools, and protocols in support of the project. Arrive at a concrete understanding as to how ZK technology can be integrated into the Casper layer one.  Identify potential applications (e.g. privacy preserving financial contracts).
	* Investigate Polygon's technology stack in respect of it's Chain Development Kit (CDK) so as to understand how it might inform or benefit the Casper ecosystem. This includes exploring the Ploygon Hermez EVM approach to scalability, privacy, and its specific implementations of ZK cryptography.  Furthermore explore how the CDK could be used for developing or testing parts of the bytecode interpreter.
	* Construct ZK Proofs for a zkWASM virtual machine specifically tailored for the Casper blockchain. This involves programming the interpreter, with an emphasis on ensuring it supports key features and functionalities of both Solidity and WASM.	
	* Create a structured and well-documented GitHub repository to host project assets. This repository should follow best practices for open-source projects, including clear documentation, issue tracking, and contribution guidelines.
	* Succesfully prototype implementation of the CDK or some other ZK L2 rollup stack on Casper.

## NOTES

	* Technical complexity: high.
	* Technical feasibilty: high.
	* Grantee track record: good.
