## Grant Milestones

* M1
	* Begin by mapping out the zk (zero-knowledge) ecosystem, focusing on identifying key technologies, tools, and protocols that can support or enhance the project. This involves understanding how zero-knowledge proofs can be integrated into the Casper blockchain and identifying potential applications and benefits.
	* Evaluate various approaches and technologies for compiling zkWASM bytecode, considering factors such as efficiency, security, and compatibility. This involves a deep dive into existing compilers, libraries, and frameworks that could be leveraged or adapted for the project.
	* Investigate Polygon Hermez's technology stack and CDK to understand how it might inform or benefit the Casper ecosystem. This includes exploring Hermez's approach to scalability, privacy, and its specific implementations of zk proofs, as well as how the CDK could be used for developing or testing parts of the bytecode interpreter.
	* Start by constructing zk Proofs for a zkWASM, specifically tailored for the Casper blockchain. This step involves programming the interpreter, with an emphasis on ensuring it supports key features and functionalities of both Solidity and WASM.	

* M2
	* Create a structured and well-documented GitHub repository to host the zk proofs. This repository should follow best practices for open-source projects, including clear documentation, issue tracking, and contribution guidelines.
	* Succesful implementation of CDK or Rollup Stack on Casper
